# Visualising-Earthquakes
Visualising Earthquakes all around the world with an interactive map

![1-Logo](1-Logo.png)

This app consists of an imported GeoJSON from the USGS API

I used leaflet to create the map. Features and properties of the map include:

-Zooming in and out
-The bigger circles are higher magnitude earthquakes
-Clicking on each circle brings up it's location, the time it happened, and it's magnitude

Enjoy!
